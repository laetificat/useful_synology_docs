# Useful Synology NAS documentation
Some useful documentation for the Synology NAS.

## Current branches
- [Synology DSM 5](tree/DSM-5)

## Reason why this repo exists
Sometimes you don't want to search into the Wiki because it has too much information, with this repo I try to document
my findings and useful tips and configuration.

## Where is the documentation?
You can find the documentation on a separate branch, every branch mirrors a DSM release.

## I'm missing documentation
If you're missing documentation what could be useful and you know how to replicate and document your configuration,
please create a pull request. Your pull request should be on a branch other than Master.

## License
All this documentation is released under the MIT license.
