# Gaining access via SSH
Before we can start make sure you have access to the Synology DSM interface.

## Enabling SSH
To enable SSH go to Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP and check "Enable SSH service". Leave the Port on 22 and click on
apply.  
This should enable the SSH service for the admin and root user. You can also enable SSH for a different user with
limited rights, [you can find out how here](Enable_ssh_for_user.md).
